# HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI

This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee data, focusing on attrition, demographics, performance tracking, and trends over time. The dashboard is designed to help HR professionals and decision-makers gain actionable insights into workforce dynamics, employee satisfaction, and attrition patterns.

# Key Insights and Analysis
As an IT-based company, this organization has a significant focus on technical roles, with a substantial number of employees in specialized positions. The workforce includes 247 Software Engineers, 197 Data Scientists, 211 Data Analysts, and 211 Machine Learning Engineers, reflecting the company’s emphasis on cutting-edge technology and data-driven solutions. 

The distribution of employees across departments further highlights this focus, with the majority concentrated in Tech and Data Management. These teams are supported by smaller but critical departments such as Finance, managed by 6 members, and Recruitment, managed by 12 members. This structure underscores the company’s reliance on technical expertise while maintaining lean and efficient support functions to drive organizational success.

# Employee Demographics
The demographic analysis provides a detailed breakdown of the workforce by age and gender. The majority of employees fall within the 20-29 years age group, totaling 829 employees, of which 367 are women. In contrast, there are 215 employees aged 50 years and above, with 95 being women. 

This distribution indicates a relatively young workforce, which may require tailored engagement and development programs to retain talent. Additionally, the gender distribution across age groups and roles is balanced, but further analysis can uncover specific areas for improvement in diversity and inclusion initiatives.

# Employee Performance Tracking

The project also includes a robust performance tracking system, focusing on the Performance Development Review (PDR) metrics. These metrics include Job Satisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, Environment Satisfaction, Self-Rating, and Manager Rating. 

By tracking these metrics over multiple periods, the dashboard allows HR teams to monitor individual and team performance, identify areas for improvement, and recognize high-performing employees. For example, employees with consistently low scores in job satisfaction or work-life balance are more likely to leave, making these metrics critical for early intervention and retention efforts.

# Employee Attrition
The project begins with an analysis of employee attrition, which is a critical metric for understanding workforce stability. The overall attrition rate is calculated at 16.2%, with significant variations across job roles and age groups. For instance, Sales Representatives have the highest attrition rate at 39%, followed by Recruiters at 34%. 

When examining attrition by age, employees aged 20-29 years show the highest attrition rate at 20.51%, while those aged 50 years and above have the lowest rate at 6.98%. Over time, attrition peaked in 2020 at 22%, likely due to external factors such as the pandemic, but has since decreased to 16% in 2022. These insights highlight the need for targeted retention strategies, especially for younger employees and high-turnover roles.

## Trends Over Time
One of the most valuable aspects of this project is its ability to track trends over time. For instance, the attrition rate was at its lowest in 2017 (10.8%), peaked in 2020 (22%), and has since stabilized at 16% in 2022. Similarly, performance metrics can be analyzed over time to identify patterns and correlations. For example, improvements in work-life balance scores may correlate with reduced attrition rates, providing actionable insights for HR strategies.

# Methodology
The project leverages Power BI for data visualization and analysis. Key steps included data cleaning (removing duplicates, handling missing values), data transformation (creating calculated columns like attrition rate and age bins), and DAX calculations for advanced metrics. 

Interactive visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps were created to make the data accessible and actionable. Statistical analysis was also used to identify correlations between performance metrics and attrition, providing deeper insights into the drivers of employee turnover.


# How to Use
To explore the dashboard, clone this repository and open the .pbix file in Power BI Desktop. Connect the report to your data source (if not already connected) and use the interactive filters to slice and dice the data by department, job role, age group, or gender. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, allowing HR professionals to generate insights and reports with ease.



# Future Enhancements
This project can be further enhanced by incorporating predictive analytics to forecast attrition risk and machine learning models to identify key drivers of employee turnover. Additionally, integrating real-time data feeds and expanding the dataset to include more granular metrics (e.g., training hours, promotion rates) can provide even deeper insights.
